# Welcome to the HyperAdapt Toolkit #

This page hosts the HyperAdapt toolkit developed in the HyperAdapt research project. The toolkit provides a language for adaptation rules (called adaptation aspects) in hypermedia applications and the generic PX-Weave XML weaving tool for such aspects, which can be run as a stand-alone Java application or as an additional componment in [Apache Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org/)-based web applications.

## Features ##
  * A generic, XML-based language for adaptation aspect specifications.
  * Different testing and validation modes for adaptation transformations, based on XML schema.
  * A simple, configureable XML-based context model.
  * A joinpoint model for adaptation aspects.
  * Detection of interactions between adaptation aspects and adaptation rules.

## Used technologies ##
The basic implementation is done in Java and XQuery. The static conflict detection is realized as an Eclipse plug-in.

## Who is working on the HyperAdapt toolkit? ##
